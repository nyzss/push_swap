# push swap project

the project uses radix sort not that interesting

### do checkout the script
you can just do `bash run.sh` and it will test your push_swap against 100 randomly generated numbers (there might be duplicates)
you can also pass in arguments of your choice for example: `bash run.sh 100 2500 5 48`
